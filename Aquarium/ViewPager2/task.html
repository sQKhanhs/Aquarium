<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>In this stage, you will learn how to work with <code class="java">ViewPager2</code> and the <code class="java">RecyclerView</code> adapter to configure it.</p>
<p>You are hanging out with colleagues and notice a child playing with the app. The kid can't read and goes straight to swiping. In the kid's magical world, it is how it goes; swipes move the world around them.</p>
<p>You return home and decide to make a pagination scheme with swiping instead. While researching the subject, you discover an Android library named <code class="java">ViewPager2</code> will give you what you want with more or less the same kind of code that you would need for <code class="java">RecyclerView</code>.</p>
<p>You think you will probably have to adapt slightly to the layout structure. Luckily all the page content was already inside the <code class="java">CardView</code>, and a simple cut-and-paste from that into a new layout <em>page_item.xml</em> and <code class="java">ViewPager2</code> would make that change come true.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>Remove the buttons!!!;</li>
<li>Create an item of <code class="java">ViewPager2</code>. You can copy the page with <code class="java">CardView</code>;</li>
<li>Place <code class="java">ViewPager2</code> in <em>activity_main.xml;</em> give it the <code class="java">viewpager2</code> id;</li>
<li>Create an adapter for <code class="java">ViewPager2</code>. Use the <code class="java">RecyclerView</code> Adapter.</li>
<li>Configure the adapter to <code class="java">ViewPager2</code>.</li>
