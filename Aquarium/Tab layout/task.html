<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Having close friends is crucial for our well-being. Let's talk about <code class="java">TabLayout</code> that is <code class="java">ViewPager2</code> close friend.</p>
<p>In a few hours, you have another meeting. You have two things on your mind. One is that you should set up a delivery system with fewer meetings.</p>
<p>The second one is the video about <code class="java">TabLayout</code> that you saw after lunch. It was a continuation of that reference video you used earlier, but you had added it to the long list of unwatched videos.</p>
<p><em>You know what...tabs are not buttons; they are cooler, and people are more used to them; you can set it to scroll if you want and give custom names for each item. Sure, they are clicky, but they can be swipy.</em></p>
<p>As you prepare for the upcoming meeting, a realization dawns on you. You have a few hours to revise your presentation and incorporate your new convictions on current ux fashion. You feel confident you can deliver a new talk, but maybe you should rewrite your speech against buttons.</p>
<p>In this stage, you will learn how to work with <code class="java">TabLayout</code>.</p>
